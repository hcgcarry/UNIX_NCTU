Please implement envvar() function in a shared object that modifies

/proc/self/environ for the current process.

The envvar() should perform the following operations:

1. assign a variable SECRET with a correct value that can bypass server checks, and
   add the variable into /proc/self/environ of the current process.

2. request the parent process to check for the variable SECRET by
   printing out the message "checkenv" (without quotes) to stdout (descriptor #1)

3. receive the check result from the parent process by
   reading the message from standard input - it can be either "pass" or "fail"

Please read the envvar.c file for more details on how environment variables are checked.

The prototype of your implemented function should be `void envvar(int, char *)`
